CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:40 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target rtabmap_viz because
  files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [liboctomap.so.1.9] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /opt/ros/foxy/lib
    runtime library [liboctomath.so.1.9] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /opt/ros/foxy/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
