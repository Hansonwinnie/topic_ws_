CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:53 (add_library):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target rtabmap_conversions
  because files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [liboctomap.so.1.9] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
